#### 💕Inspirations and credit:
This [game](https://codepen.io/anniebombanie/pen/NWNEGXZ?editors=0010) by @anniebombanie became the springboard for my own Tic Tac Toe game.

And credit to this [collection of easter eggs](https://github.com/WeiChiaChang/easter-egg-collection) by Wei Chia Chang, which you can read through and type in the game at any point for cute images to appear.

#### 🐜Bugs and Improvements:

At time of writing, there are issues with the score logging automatically when the flower player wins. I'd like to add some animation as well.

#### 🤗Thank yous:

Thank you to my wonderful teachers at GA for guiding me through my first project and also my best friend: **Google**.
