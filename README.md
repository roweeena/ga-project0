#### Inspirations:
This [game](https://codepen.io/anniebombanie/pen/NWNEGXZ?editors=0010) by @anniebombanie became the springboard for my own Tic Tac Toe game.

#### Bugs and Improvements:

At time of writing, the game can only play one game properly. I hope to fix this as soon as possible and add some animations/an easter egg.

#### Thank yous:

Thank you to my wonderful teachers at GA for guiding me through my first project and also my best friend: **Google**.
